      <h1>Grapevine closing</h1>
      <p>Team Grapevine would like to thank all of you who have used Grapevine and those of you who helped make Grapevine a success.  Grapevine was the first on the scene to show a new dynamic in person to person, person to group, and group to group communication.  It's been a great trip in introducing this new communication paradigm and thanks for joining us for the ride.</p>
      <p>We Team Grapevine, have decided it's time to withdraw Grapevine from open usage and move on to the next chapter.  Don't worry - if something cool comes up, we will be sure to get ahold of you!</p>
      <p>If you do want to contact us <a href="mailto:help@grapevinetalk.com">help@grapevinetalk.com</a> is still active.</p>
      <p>Thanks for all the fish,</p>
      <p>Team Grapevine</p>
